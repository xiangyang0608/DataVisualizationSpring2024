                What Causes Cardiovascular Disease and What You Should Do to Prevent It.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Cardiovascular disease(CVD)  is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, affecting millions of lives each year. 
                Knowing the causes of CVD allows individuals to take preventive measures. Many risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and lack of physical activity, are modifiable through lifestyle changes. <br>
                Despite this, many of these deaths are preventable through the modification of lifestyle factors and the management of health conditions. The World Health Organization has identified cost-effective interventions that can be implemented even in resource-limited settings, emphasizing the importance of awareness and education. <br>
                This project seeks to leverage the power of data visualization to convey complex health data in an accessible and impactful way, aiming to inform, educate, and inspire action among the general public and at-risk individuals. <br>
                By visualizing the interplay between various risk factors and daily habits with the prevalence and risk of CVD, we aim to highlight the potential for individual and community action to mitigate these risks.

                    As we can see, patients above 55 years old are more likely to have CVD than younger patients. 
                    While gender has almost no impact on the risk of CVD, it is slightly more likely for men to have CVD.

                    BMI is a significant factor for CVD . It can be observed that overweight and obese patients have a higher possibility to have CVD. However, the change in lifestyle can reduce your risks. 
                    Patients who exercise have a lower chance of having CVD than patients who do not exercise.

                    Now let’s see the statistic for blood pressure and cardiovascular disease
                    Systolic pressure is the maximum blood pressure during contraction of the ventricles. 
                    Diastolic pressure is the minimum pressure recorded just prior to the next contraction. <br>
                    The blood pressure is usually written as the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure (e.g. 120/80 mm Hg). 
                    Patients' blood pressure are interpreted according to the National Institute of Health’s classification of blood pressure levels. <br>
                    CVD patients have higher average blood pressure than people with no cardiovascular disease.
                    You can explore more on the impact of health conditions and lifestyle to CVD.
