                Cardiovascular disease(CVD)  is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, affecting millions of lives each year. Knowing the causes of CVD allows individuals to take preventive measures. <br>
                Many risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and lack of physical activity, are modifiable through lifestyle changes. Despite this, many of these deaths are preventable through the modification of lifestyle factors and the management of health conditions. <br>
                The World Health Organization has identified cost-effective interventions that can be implemented even in resource-limited settings, emphasizing the importance of awareness and education. <br>
                This project seeks to leverage the power of data visualization to convey complex health data in an accessible and impactful way, aiming to inform, educate, and inspire action among the general public and at-risk individuals. <br>
                By visualizing the interplay between various risk factors and daily habits with the prevalence and risk of CVD, we aim to highlight the potential for individual and community action to mitigate these risks.

                2. What impact do lifestyle choices (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity) have on the risk of developing CVD, independent of other medical conditions?
