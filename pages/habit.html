            </h2>
            <p>
                This page presents an intuitive platform for the investigation of how everyday behaviours can impact the risk of Cardiovascular Disease (“CVD”). 
                Horizontal bar charts illustrate the normalised percentages of individuals with different habits (activity level, smoking habit, and alcohol intake) in relation to their respective CVD risks. Doughnut charts provide more specific insights into CVD risks within specified demographic groups according to the filters. 
                Additional interactive features include the ability to click on the bar chart, doughnut chart, and legend to emphasize and explore information related to CVD risk.

            <h2>
                Analysis of Activity Level on the Risk of Cardiovascular Health
            </h2>
            <p>
                From the bar chart, it is evident that individuals with a more active lifestyle have a reduced risk of CVD as compared to those who are inactive. 
                The doughnut charts suggest a prevailing trend that as BMI and age increase, so does the risk of CVD. 
                Regarding gender, men typically exhibit a higher risk of CVD than women across all BMI categories and age groups. 
                Similarly, inactive individuals face a higher overall risk of CVD across all demographics.

            <h2>
                Analysis of Smoking Habits on the Risk of Cardiovascular Health
            </h2>
            <p>
                From the bar chart, individuals who smoke have a higher risk of normalised risk of CVD and similarly, the doughnut chart below suggests the same. 
                However, this goes against the National Institute of Health’s research whereby smoking was found to be a major risk factor of CVD. 
                The results seen might be due to the imbalance between data available for smokers and non-smokers.

                Analysis of Alcohol Consumption on the Risk of Cardiovascular Health
            </h2>
            <p>
                Similarly, the disproportionate amount of data representing non-alcohol consumers leads to a slight skew in the analysis, which may present alcohol consumers as having a marginally lower percentage of CVD incidents. 
                The smaller sample size of alcohol consumers can skew results and lead to the overall misinterpretation of risk.

                Notably, individuals with a higher body mass index (BMI), advanced age, those identifying as male, and those with sedentary lifestyles consistently show an increased risk for CVD. 
                It should be noted that although data presented shows otherwise, other professional medical bodies have found that the use of alcohol and nicotine leads to an increased risk of CVD. 
                Below is a summary bar chart for all the information shown above.
